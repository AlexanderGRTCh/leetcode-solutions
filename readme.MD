LeetCode Solutions
A collection of my solutions to popular LeetCode coding problems, organized by category and approach.

Structure
- /array/: Solutions using array techniques (brute-force, simple loops, etc.)
- /hashmap/: Solutions using hash maps/dictionaries for optimal performance.

Each solution is written in Python and includes comments for clarity.
Example
- array/twoSumsBruteForce.py: Brute-force solution for the Two Sum problem.
- hashmap/twoSumsHash.py: Optimal hash map solution for the Two Sum problem.
Goals
- Practice and document common coding interview problems.
- Demonstrate both brute-force and optimal approaches where possible.
- Build a personal reference for data structures and algorithms in Python.
How to Use
Clone the repo:
    git clone https://github.com/AlexanderGRTCh/leetcode-solutions.git
Browse code in each folder for problem statements and solutions.
Notes
- All code is written in Python 3.
- File and folder names match problem categories and solution strategies.
